## How It Works

Dialogue is different from typical Q&A apps:

1. **All data is embedded** — No server calls needed
2. **Works offline** — Once loaded, internet is optional
3. **Privacy first** — Nothing leaves your device

---

## Use Cases

- Quick reference without internet
- Learning tool for language practice
- Offline documentation access

## Languages

| Language | Path |

## Install as App

Dialogue is a Progressive Web App (PWA):

1. Visit the website on your device
2. Look for "Install" or "Add to Home Screen"
3. Use like a native app — even offline
